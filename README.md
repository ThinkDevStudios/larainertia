# Laravel in WordPress Theme

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It's one of the most popular PHP frameworks today.

Laraish brings the Laravel Framework into WordPress, which allow us to have all the benefits of Laravel. So you can create themes with less effort, more enjoyment!


## Requirement

The 99% of Laraish is just the regular full stack PHP Framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). So if you have never heard of it, you're going to want to take a look at it before you can go any further.

For those who are already familiar with Laravel, it should be a piece of cake for you to get started with Laraish.
